**Arabic Time Package** is a PHP package that helps you display time in Arabic format. It's designed to be easy to integrate into your Laravel applications, but it can be used in any PHP project.

## Features

- Display time in Arabic language format.
- Easy integration with Blade templates in Laravel.
- Supports different time formats and customization.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require getarabictimepackage/arabic-time
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After installing the package, you can use it directly in your PHP code to display the current time in Arabic format:

```php
use GetArabicTimePackage\ArabicTime\ArabicTime;

echo ArabicTime::now(); // Displays the current time in Arabic
```

### Custom Time Formatting

You can also format the time according to your needs:

```php
use GetArabicTimePackage\ArabicTime\ArabicTime;

$time = new DateTime('now');
echo ArabicTime::format($time, 'H:i'); // Displays time in Arabic with a custom format
```

### Blade Directives (Laravel Only)

If you're using Laravel, you can utilize the provided Blade directives for easier integration:

1. Register the service provider in `config/app.php` (if not auto-discovered):

    ```php
    'providers' => [
        // Other service providers...
        GetArabicTimePackage\ArabicTime\ArabicTimeServiceProvider::class,
    ],
    ```

2. Use the directives in your Blade views:

    ```blade
    @arabicTime($time) // Converts the given DateTime instance to Arabic time
    ```

### Example in Blade

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ar">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Arabic Time Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>الوقت الحالي: @arabicTime(now())</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
